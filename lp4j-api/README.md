lp4j
====

LP4J is a client API for the Novation Launchpad S DJ pad.
It provides high- and low-level APIs to send commands to the device, and react when its keys and buttons are pressed.

The high-level API is MIDI-agnostic, so it can be used with a software emulator.
The low-level API is MIDI-specific, and can be used to send and decode raw MIDI messages.
